# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Turbo Start Sanity — a pnpm monorepo (Turborepo) with a Next.js 16 frontend and a Sanity Studio v6 CMS. Uses Biome/Ultracite for linting/formatting.

## Commands

```bash
# Development (both apps)
pnpm dev

# Individual apps
pnpm dev:web          # Next.js on localhost:3000 (Turbopack)
pnpm dev:studio       # Sanity Studio on localhost:3333

# Build
pnpm build            # All packages
pnpm build:web        # Next.js only
pnpm build:studio     # Studio only

# Lint & Format (Biome/Ultracite, NOT ESLint/Prettier)
pnpm lint             # Lint all
pnpm format           # Format all (auto-fix)
pnpm format:check     # Check formatting without fixing
pnpm check-types      # TypeScript type checking

# Per-package lint/format
cd apps/web && pnpm lint
cd apps/studio && pnpm format

# Sanity type generation (run after schema changes — both, in this order)
pnpm --filter studio extract   # Refresh the committed apps/studio/schema.json
pnpm type                      # Generate types from schema.json (root via turbo, or apps/studio)

# Tests
pnpm test             # Vitest unit tests (currently only @workspace/sanity-blocks)
pnpm test:e2e         # Playwright smoke tests (apps/web, needs a running/deployed site)
pnpm --filter web test:e2e:presentation  # Studio → website loop (Presentation drafts, publish, live update, no leaks); starts Studio on 3333 + `next build && next start` on 3000
```

Note: `pnpm test` at the root is `turbo run test`, which today only reaches
`@workspace/sanity-blocks` — the one package with a `test` script. Run a single
package's suite with `pnpm --filter @workspace/sanity-blocks test`.

## Architecture

### Data Flow: Sanity → Next.js

1. **Schema** block types defined in `packages/sanity-blocks/src/` and re-exported via `@workspace/sanity-blocks`. Studio registers them via `apps/studio/schemaTypes/index.ts`
2. **Type generation**: `pnpm --filter studio extract` refreshes the committed `apps/studio/schema.json`, then `pnpm type` (repo root via turbo, or in `apps/studio`) generates TS types at `packages/sanity/src/sanity.types.ts`. `pnpm type` alone reads the old `schema.json`, so a new block silently never reaches the generated types
3. **GROQ queries** live in `packages/sanity/src/query.ts` using `defineQuery` from `next-sanity`, with reusable fragments
4. **Data fetching** uses `sanityFetch` from `packages/sanity/src/live.ts` (wraps `defineLive` for automatic revalidation)
5. **Client** configured in `packages/sanity/src/client.ts` with stega for visual editing

### Page Builder Pattern

The core content model is a **page builder** — an array of typed blocks:

- **Schema source**: `packages/sanity-blocks/src/<block>/` — files are named after the block, e.g. `cta/cta.schema.ts`, `cta/cta.groq.ts`, `cta/index.tsx`, `cta/markdown.ts`, `cta/thumbnail.png`, plus co-located `*.test.tsx` / `*-markdown.test.ts`. All schemas are exported as `blockSchemas` from `packages/sanity-blocks/src/sanity-blocks.ts`
- **Studio side**: `apps/studio/schemaTypes/index.ts` merges `blockSchemas` into the exported `schemaTypes`, and `apps/studio/schemaTypes/definitions/pagebuilder.ts` maps over `blockSchemas` to build the array members — so a block added to `blockSchemas` shows up in the page builder automatically, no manual registration. Its insert-menu grid preview is `/static/thumbnails/preview-<kebab-case-name>.png`, copied from each block's `thumbnail.png` by the studio's `sync-thumbnails` script (runs on `postinstall`)
- **Frontend side**: `apps/web/src/components/pagebuilder.tsx` — renders each `_type` via `renderBlockComponent`. Includes Sanity visual editing data attributes and optimistic updates
- **Block components**: `packages/sanity-blocks/src/<block>/index.tsx` — styled implementations using Tailwind + `@workspace/ui`, imported by `pagebuilder.tsx` from `@workspace/sanity-blocks/<block>/index` and rendered directly. These are the production render layer

To add a new page builder block:

1. Create `packages/sanity-blocks/src/<new-block>/` with `<new-block>.schema.ts` and `<new-block>.groq.ts`
2. Export the schema from `packages/sanity-blocks/src/sanity-blocks.ts` and add it to the `blockSchemas` array — Studio then picks it up automatically through `apps/studio/schemaTypes/index.ts` and `definitions/pagebuilder.ts`
3. Import the block's GROQ projection in `packages/sanity/src/query.ts` and include it in `pageBuilderFragment`
4. Run `pnpm --filter studio extract` then `pnpm type` to regenerate Sanity types — both, in that order
5. Create the styled component as `packages/sanity-blocks/src/<new-block>/index.tsx`
6. Register in `renderBlockComponent` in `apps/web/src/components/pagebuilder.tsx` (imported from `@workspace/sanity-blocks/<new-block>/index`)
7. Add `packages/sanity-blocks/src/<new-block>/markdown.ts` exporting a `<newBlock>ToMarkdown` serializer, then wire it into the `blockToMarkdown` switch in `packages/sanity-blocks/src/internal/page-builder-to-markdown.ts` (a thin dispatcher — the serializers themselves live with their blocks) so the block degrades to semantic Markdown. Reuse `headingToMarkdown` from `internal/markdown.ts` and `portableTextToMarkdown` from `internal/portable-text-to-markdown.ts`, and add a test asserting no JSX leaks. Without this, the new block renders blank in `.md` output
8. Add `packages/sanity-blocks/src/<new-block>/thumbnail.png` so the block has a preview in the Studio insert menu, then run `pnpm --filter studio sync-thumbnails`

### Markdown content negotiation

Any page is also served as Markdown for LLMs/agents: append `.md` to the URL (`/about.md`, `/blog/post.md`, `/index.md`) or send `Accept: text/markdown`. `apps/web/src/proxy.ts` rewrites those requests to `apps/web/src/app/api/markdown/route.ts`, which fetches the page's Sanity data and serializes it via `pageBuilderToMarkdown` — the Markdown counterpart of `renderBlockComponent`. Because it serializes structured data (never React), components can't leak as raw `<Component/>` tags; unknown block types return `""`. See step 7 above to support a new block.

### Video (Mux)

Video is hosted on Mux, not stored as a Sanity file asset. `sanity-plugin-mux-input` (registered in `apps/studio/sanity.config.ts`) adds the `mux.video` field type; use the `muxVideoField()` helper from `packages/sanity-blocks/src/internal/schema-fields.ts` (it takes optional `validation` and `hidden`) and the `muxVideoFields` GROQ fragment, which resolves the referenced `mux.videoAsset` down to `{ playbackId, aspectRatio, status, thumbTime, title, policy }`. One upload covers every device — Mux serves an adaptive HLS ladder — so schemas carry a single video field, not a per-format set. The hero is the exception, and keeps both; see the end of this section.

Helpers live in `packages/sanity-blocks/src/internal/mux.ts` and every value that reaches a URL or a CSS declaration is stega-cleaned there, because Visual Editing encodes invisible characters into strings. `muxPlaybackId` is the only way to read a playback ID, and it withholds one when Mux reports `errored` or when the playback policy is anything but `public` (signed playback needs JWTs this starter does not mint). It deliberately does **not** gate on `status === "ready"`: that field is patched by a poll running in the editor's browser tab, so it stalls at `preparing` whenever the tab closes mid-encode, and gating on it would hide a playable video indefinitely.

Upload settings are left on the plugin defaults (`video_quality: "plus"`, 1080p ceiling, public playback); every upload is billed, so each project should pick its own tier in `sanity.config.ts`. Mux API credentials are **not** env vars: an editor pastes the token ID and secret into the plugin's setup screen the first time they upload, and the Studio stores them in the dataset as `secrets.mux`. That is a trade, not just a convenience — on a public dataset the secret key is readable by anyone who can query it, so scope the token to the minimum the plugin actually needs — Mux Video read/write **and Mux Data read**, per its own README — and keep the dataset private if that matters.

Two render paths, deliberately different:

- **Content video** — `internal/mux-video.tsx` renders a facade: the Mux still and a play button, with `@mux/mux-player-react` behind a `next/dynamic` import that only resolves once a visitor presses play. Until then neither the player chunk nor the video bytes Mux bills are spent on someone who never watches. `disableTracking` keeps Mux Data off both paths — drop it and set an `envKey` to turn analytics on. The block renders its copy even when no video resolves, matching the Markdown serializer.
- **Hero background** — the bare `@mux/mux-video-react` element behind a `next/dynamic` import, so hls.js stays off pages with no video. It autoplays, which makes it the one surface billed for Mux delivery on every page view, and its `maxResolution` / `renditionOrder` props are pinned for a reason the comment beside them explains. A variant is a Mux clip, a picture, or both; leave the picture empty and the clip's own still stands in at the editor's `thumbTime`.

The hero is the one block that offers a choice of delivery. Each theme variant carries a `mediaType`:

- **`sanity`** (the default) — the hand-encoded set: an AV1 `.webm`, an HEVC `.mp4`, and a smaller `.webm` for phones, served straight off the asset CDN. No player, no manifest.
- **`mux`** — the adaptive HLS ladder, driven by hls.js.
- **`mux-mp4`** — the same Mux asset as one progressive MP4. No player either, but it only works where static renditions were enabled (`POST /video/v1/assets/{id}/static-renditions`); Mux 404s `{resolution}.mp4` until they are, and bills storage per rendition kept.

`sanity` is the default because it measured smallest and sharpest on this hero — 2.02 MB at 3408×2160 against 2.92 MB at 1704×1080 for `mux-mp4` — and ships no JavaScript. Mux earns its place on blocks an editor uploads to often, not on the one clip that autoplays on every visit.

`hero.groq.ts` projects both paths regardless of the setting, so flipping the toggle in Presentation does not blank the background while the query re-runs, and the Studio hides whichever set is not selected.

`mediaTypeOf` in `packages/sanity-blocks/src/hero/media-type.ts` is the only way to read that choice, and `isMuxPath` is how callers ask "does this resolve a playback id" without caring which Mux path it is. `mediaTypeOf` **infers** rather than defaults when the field is absent, because the field arrived after the documents did — a blank value means "read what the variant actually carries", so heroes authored before the toggle keep rendering. Nothing ever infers to `mux-mp4`: static renditions are opt-in per asset, so that path is only reached by an explicit choice. It lives outside `hero-video.tsx` on purpose: that is a client module pulling in the Mux player graph, and the Markdown serializer needs the same answer without paying for hls.js.

Because `next/dynamic` resolves only when the adaptive element renders, a hero set to `sanity` or `mux-mp4` never downloads the player — measured at 793 bytes of JS between them, against 648,817 bytes for the hls.js bundle. That isolation is what makes `/sanity-video-delivery`, `/mux-video-delivery` and `/mux-mp4-video-delivery` — three `page` documents cloning the homepage page builder with only `mediaType` flipped — a fair measurement of one delivery path against another.

### Sanity Document Types

**Singletons** (one instance each): `homePage`, `blogIndex`, `settings`, `footer`, `navbar`
**Documents**: `blog`, `page`, `faq`, `author`, `redirect`
**Pages** use nested slug-based structure (`apps/studio/components/nested-pages-structure.ts`)

### Environment Variables

Canonical source of truth is `apps/web/.env.example` and `apps/studio/.env.example`. Copy them to `.env` (or `.env.local`) in the same folder.

**`apps/web`** (validated by `@workspace/env`):

- Required: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_STUDIO_URL`, `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN`, `SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN`
- Optional: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION` (blank or unset falls back to `DEFAULT_SANITY_API_VERSION` from `@workspace/env/constants`, which uses the current UTC date at runtime), `SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET` (shared secret for the `/api/revalidate-sync-tags` webhook; the route fails closed when unset), and `SANITY_CONTEXT_ENDPOINT`, `SANITY_CONTEXT_TOKEN` for the FAQ block's ask row (`/api/ask` returns 503 until both are set). The ask row calls Claude through Vercel AI Gateway, which authenticates with `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` or, on Vercel and after `vercel env pull`, the project's `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL` are also validated but default to localhost, so they need no local value
- Optional, Algolia blog search: `ALGOLIA_APP_ID`, `ALGOLIA_ADMIN_API_KEY` (server-only; webhook + backfill), `ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY`, `ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME`, and `SANITY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (Sanity → Algolia webhook and backfill; both routes fail closed when unset; `/api/blog/search` answers 503)

Caveat: `SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN` is currently required by `packages/env/src/server.ts` even though no runtime code reads it. `apps/web/next.config.ts` imports `@workspace/env/server`, so `next dev` and `next build` both fail fast if it is unset.

**`apps/studio`** (plain `process.env`, loaded via `dotenv`/Vite — not `@workspace/env`):

- Required: `SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID`, `SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET`
- Optional: `SANITY_STUDIO_TITLE`, `SANITY_STUDIO_API_VERSION` (defaults to `DEFAULT_SANITY_API_VERSION` from `@workspace/env/constants`, which uses the current UTC date at runtime, in `apps/studio/utils/constant.ts`), `SANITY_STUDIO_APP_ID` (written back after the first `sanity deploy`), `SANITY_STUDIO_PRESENTATION_URL` (required whenever `NODE_ENV` is not `development` — `utils/helper.ts` returns `http://localhost:3000` in development and throws otherwise, so an unset or `test` `NODE_ENV` throws too)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and `SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET` are read only by the deployed Sanity Function `apps/studio/functions/invalidate-tags`, not by the Studio itself
- Optional: `SANITY_STUDIO_ALGOLIA_APP_ID`, `SANITY_STUDIO_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_KEY`, `SANITY_STUDIO_ALGOLIA_INDEX` for the blog "SEO & Index" tab. Bundled into the browser by Vite, so search-only key only

Web env vars are Zod-validated at startup via `@workspace/env` (`@workspace/env/client` and `@workspace/env/server`).

### Types Strategy

All frontend types derive from generated Sanity types. `apps/web/src/types.ts` extracts narrow types from query results using `Extract`, `NonNullable`, and index access — never manually duplicate Sanity shapes.

### Visual Editing & Live Preview

- Sanity Presentation Tool configured in `sanity.config.ts` with `presentationTool`
- Next.js renders `VisualEditingLayer` (`VisualEditing` from `next-sanity/visual-editing` plus this app's overlay components) in layout (draft mode only)
- `createDataAttribute` used throughout page builder for click-to-edit in Presentation
- `SanityLive` component enables automatic content revalidation

#### Double-click to type (custom Presentation overlay)

`apps/web/src/components/overlay-components.tsx` is the resolver handed to
`<VisualEditing components={...} />` through `visual-editing-layer.tsx` (its own
client component, because a function cannot cross the server/client boundary).
It returns `InlineText` when `isInlineEditable` in `inline-text.tsx` allows it:
the element holds a single text node, sits outside any link, button, summary
or label (the click capture would swallow their handlers), and either

- **Plain strings**: carries the bare `data-inline-edit` flag over a `string` field. Never flag a multi-line `text` field: nothing at runtime can tell the two apart, Enter saves, and a paste collapses newlines. `BlockEyebrow`, `BlockHeader`'s title and each block's own plain-string titles, subtitles, captions and testimonial author lines carry it. Opt-in, because the resolver also sees every nav link, button label and badge
- **Rich text**: has a Portable Text span path (`…children[_key=="s"].text`). The words in a one-span paragraph, or in the bold/italic run inside one, can be typed over. Plain runs in a paragraph that also has marks, and marks, links and new paragraphs themselves, stay in the Studio form

`inline-text.tsx` makes the element `contentEditable="plaintext-only"` on
double-click and saves once on blur through `useDocuments()`, to the overlay
node's own `id` and `path`. Sanity ships nothing official for inline typing;
this is custom on that documented API. The rules that keep typing and page
updates from trampling each other (strip stega first, save only on blur, put
typed text back over a render, rewrite React's text node in place, restore on
cancel, empty or a locally rejected patch (the Studio's own write is
fire-and-forget, so a server rejection is not reported back), end without
saving if React restructures the
text mid-edit, clean up if the element is removed) live as comments in
`inline-text.tsx`. No real click on an editable element reaches the overlay: a
click opening the field makes the Studio focus its input, which ends an edit
mid-word. A single click is replayed after the double-click window, and Enter
opens the field with the saved value. Saving is last-write-wins, as in the
Studio form. Inline
editing is on only when the preview's perspective is drafts: `LivePreviewLayer`
passes that to `VisualEditingLayer`, because saves always write `drafts.<id>`,
which a published or release preview never shows. In a drafts preview, text
from the published document stays editable, because a page with no draft
renders from it and the first save creates the draft.

Visitors never mount any of it: `VisualEditingLayer` renders only in draft
mode, and the `data-inline-edit` attribute is inert outside Presentation.

## Conventions

### File Naming

- **kebab-case** for all files: `feature-cards-icon.ts`, `blog-card.tsx`
- `.tsx` for React components, `.ts` for utilities

### Sanity Schema

- Always use `defineType`, `defineField`, `defineArrayMember` from `sanity`
- Include `description` on every field (written for non-technical users)
- Icons: block schemas use `lucide-react` (all ten do) — stub any new one in
  `sanity-blocks/src/internal/testing/lucide-react.mock.tsx`. `@sanity/icons` is
  for Studio UI and Portable Text config
- GROQ: don't expand images unless explicitly needed. Use `defineQuery` from `next-sanity`

### Frontend

- Prefer `grid` over `flex` unless two sibling elements
- Use `SanityImage` component for Sanity images (from `sanity-image` library)
- Use `SanityButtons` resolver for button arrays
- Shared UI components in `@workspace/ui` (Base UI + CVA pattern; only `Slot` is Radix)

### Formatting (Biome)

- Double quotes, semicolons, trailing commas (ES5), 2-space indent, 80 char line width
- Import ordering: node/packages → blank line → aliases/paths
- `noConsole: warn`, `noExplicitAny: warn`
- Use `@workspace/logger` Logger class instead of raw `console.*`

### Node/Runtime

- Node >= 24 required (`engines.node` in the root `package.json`)
- pnpm 11.24.0, pinned via `packageManager` — enable with `corepack enable`
- Turborepo handles task orchestration — `transit` task runs before lint/format/check-types
